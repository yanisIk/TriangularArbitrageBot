what my criteria is for finding good candidates for trade setups:

1. Market Capitalization: 
the sweet spot is between $20mill and $250mill, you are looking for coins that 
are coming into the top 200-300 and are just coming on to the radar of people 

2. Exchanges listed: 
I am becoming more focused on coins not on trex and binance because:
1) no new users are coming on tothose platforms
2) the hidden gems are going to be on the lesser exchanges that eventually 
make it to the big boys exchanges and this where profits can be really massive

3. Age of the coin:
ideally I am looking for fresh virgin coins that have not spent months to years 
languishing accumlating bagholders and overhead resistance 

4. Social metrics: 
how many twitter followers, blog posts/updates, reddits subscribers 
all go to see what kind of inertia the project may have and how far a long in the awareness cycle. 
Also look to whether they just suck at social/marketing and whether that is a deal breaker or just a minor setback

There are other things I look at regarding team and such but I feel like that is generally a case by case and subjective. 
After I have determined all this I am looking for entry at support or at breakout to continue momentum

Code: 
- get coinmarketcap list of coins between 20M and 250M cap
- get bittrex/binance list of coins
- keep coins that are not on bittrex and binance
- keep fresh coins (less than 6 months ?)
- keep coins with some social media activity

WARNING: a good counter example is SelfKey: big ICO, big social media, lot of hype => bad investment
