1) Detect fake support levels 
    (the ones visible on graph but that have no real support in the orderbook)
2) Send limit buy orders @ fake support level
3) Wait for whale to come
4) Sell at previous stable price
5) Lambo


--- SIMPLIFIED VERSION ---

1- Detect thin order books on the buy side
    (Which means easy to eat for a whale that wants to crash the price)
    - Wall: {rate, priceDistance, qtyDistance}
2- Place limit buy order at the first buy wall 
3- Wait for a whale to come ? (what if it doesn't come)
4- Sell at previous stable price
5- Lambo

Data:

Use cryptocompare websocket api

- Fetch realtime filled orders and process them in windows
- save output of windows in db and emit them on ws (pubnub ?)

IDEA:
- Calculate ratio of: number of BTC to eat to drop price 1% => BTC/percent
- Calculate it for each % drop: 1% => 1.2 BTC/percent, 2% 1.9 BTC/percent ... until it goes high too much (which means hit a wall)
